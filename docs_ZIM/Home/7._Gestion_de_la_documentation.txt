====== 7. Gestion de la documentation ======

===== During the documentation process =====
We propose a generic tree folder to organize in an efficient way all the data produce with this protocole. It could be of course adapted to meet the requirement of each project.

* 0_misc
* 1_A0_acquisitions
* LG (for LaserGrammetry)
* LiDAR
* PG (for PhotoGrammetry)
	* SL (for Structured Light)
	* ...
* 1_A0_archive
* 2_Blender (or any software used to produce 3D models)
* 2_MetaShape
* 3_V0
* 4_GeometricDescription

===== After the documentation process =====
Project folder must be cleaned of all the temporary files.
Important data must be archived through the software [[https://altag3d.huma-num.fr/|aLTAG3D]].
