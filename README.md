# PETRA </br> *Protocol Employing Three dimensional Representations in Archaeology*

## Introduction
Three-dimensional models are nowadays widely used to document the existing heritage or the heritage being excavated. Very often, we find that it is difficult to process the information contained in 3D models: it is all there, in front of us, but it is extremely difficult to analyse it easily.

The approach we adopt is to extract the information one by one in the form of a corpus of superimposable images in order to establish a geometrical description of the object of study. It is indeed much easier to work in 2D than in 3D - just as word processing (1D) is much more accessible than graphic design tools (2D). The reduction of the 3D model into a 2D image is carried out according to the rules of representation which associate plan views with elevations, rules which were established at Renaissance and which allow the study objects to be compared efficiently with each other.

## Download
In order to run the tool, you will need:
+ [Blender 3.4 or higher](https://www.blender.org)
+ The latest version of PETRA, which consists of two modules (they should be installed in this order):
  1. [PETRA, version 0.4](https://github.com/valiGrimO/PETrA/raw/main/download/petra_blender_addon_v0-4.zip) (don't unzip it)
  2. [PETRA_extended, version 0.4](https://github.com/valiGrimO/PETrA/raw/main/download/petra_extended_v0-4.zip) (don't unzip it)
+ And these two others plugins
  + Render Button [Original repository](https://github.com/MajorBarnulf/my-big-button/blob/da32ee100944f18a7e41488e75677971109d6e8b/render_button.py), or for more convenience, [here (unzip the file before installing it)](https://github.com/valiGrimO/PETrA/raw/main/download/render_button.zip)
  + [DeviationMap_Petra ((unzip the file before installing it))](https://github.com/valiGrimO/PETrA/raw/main/download/DeviationMap_PETRA.zip)
